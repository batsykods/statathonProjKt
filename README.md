# 🛡️ Evaluation of Effectiveness of Data Encryption/Anonymisation & Creation of Improved Safe Data Tool

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on evaluating the **effectiveness of various data encryption and anonymisation techniques** to ensure secure handling of sensitive information.  
It also involves building an **Improved Safe Data Tool** that automates the process of securing, anonymising, and sharing datasets in compliance with privacy standards.

By combining **security analysis** and **practical tool development**, this project bridges the gap between **theory and real-world implementation** in data privacy.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Analyse & Compare** different encryption algorithms and anonymisation methods.
2. **Measure Effectiveness** using parameters such as security strength, performance, and resistance to attacks.
3. **Develop a Safe Data Tool** that:
   - Automates encryption/anonymisation.
   - Supports multiple algorithms.
   - Ensures compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
4. **Provide Recommendations** for optimal techniques in different use-cases.

## 🏗️ Features of the Safe Data Tool
- 🔒 **Encryption**: AES, RSA, and other configurable algorithms.
- 🕵️ **Anonymisation**: Masking, pseudonymisation, generalisation, k-anonymity.
- ⚡ **Batch Processing** for large datasets.
- 📊 **Security & Performance Metrics**.
- 🌐 **Export Options**: Secure JSON/CSV sharing.
- 📜 **Compliance Check** for privacy laws.
