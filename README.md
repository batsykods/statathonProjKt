Encryption/Anonymisation and Creation of improved Safe Data Tool 

Safe Data Tool - Solution & Approach
The Safe Data Tool is designed to provide researchers and analysts with access to necessary data insights while ensuring maximum privacy, security, and compliance with data protection regulations. It achieves this by combining targeted data filtering with multiple layers of anonymisation and encryption.
Problem Statement
In the era of big data, sensitive information is often exposed when sharing datasets with third parties. Researchers may require only specific subsets of data, but currently, they often receive full datasets with unnecessary personal details, which can lead to privacy risks.
Proposed Solution
Our approach involves providing only the specific details required by the user, while removing all unnecessary personal identifiers. For example, if a researcher needs the number of people residing in Dehradun earning more than ₹20 lakh per month, the system will provide only the count or relevant aggregated statistics, without revealing names, ages, addresses, or other personal information.
Enhanced Approach (Layered Security)
To ensure both efficiency and security, the proposed filtering approach is combined with additional security layers:
1. Data Filtering Engine – Extracts only relevant data.
2. Anonymisation Layer – Masks or removes personally identifiable information.
3. Encryption Layer – Secures both stored and transmitted data.
4. Access Control – Restricts dataset access based on user roles.
5. Audit Logging – Maintains logs for compliance and monitoring.
