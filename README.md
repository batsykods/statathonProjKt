Encryption/Anonymisation and Creation of improved Safe Data Tool 
Milestone 1 — Planning & Architecture
 Gather requirements from stakeholders (researchers, data owners, legal team)

 Define use-cases & query patterns

 Create system architecture diagram

 Select tech stack:

Backend: Python (FastAPI / Flask)

Frontend: React / Next.js

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

Encryption: AES-256, TLS 1.3

Privacy Layer: Differential Privacy Library

 Set up GitHub repository and branching strategy

Milestone 2 — Data Filtering Engine (Your Core Idea)
 Create database schema with only necessary fields

 Implement query filtering to return only required data

 Add logic for conditions (e.g., income > X, location = Y)

 Write unit tests for filtering rules

 Optimise queries for performance

Milestone 3 — Privacy Layer
 Integrate differential privacy for aggregate queries

 Add row count thresholds (prevent small group identification)

 Apply data masking for sensitive fields (names, addresses, IDs)

 Build policy engine to enforce compliance rules

 Test with simulated attack scenarios

Milestone 4 — Encryption & Security
 Implement AES-256 encryption for data at rest

 Enable TLS 1.3 for secure data transfer

 Create secure Key Management System (KMS)

 Add role-based access control (RBAC)

 Conduct penetration testing

Milestone 5 — API Development
 Build REST/GraphQL APIs for data requests

 Add JWT-based authentication

 Implement API rate limiting & logging

 Document API endpoints in Swagger/OpenAPI

Milestone 6 — Frontend Dashboard
 Design UI mockups for researcher portal

 Implement login/authentication system

 Add query builder interface

 Display filtered, anonymised results

 Add CSV/Excel export option

Milestone 7 — Integration & Testing
 Integrate backend, frontend, and security layers

 Perform unit, integration, and load testing

 Run security vulnerability scans

 Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with researchers

Milestone 8 — Deployment & Documentation
 Deploy backend & frontend to AWS/GCP/Azure

 Configure CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions / Jenkins)

 Write developer documentation

 Create user guide for researchers

 Monitor system performance post-launch
